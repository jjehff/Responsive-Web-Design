          <p><code><strong>Skyblock</strong></code> is a minecraft gamemode that features a small island that you expand on as you progress. Hypixel takes this idea of a gamemode and expands further on it and designing it similar to an MMORPG.</p>
          <p>There are many things that you can do in this game including solo content such as Slayers where you collect enough experience to spawn a boss or team content such as dungeons or a kuudra fight</p>
          <p>In this page, I will be talking about the basics of <code>Kuudra</code>.</p>

        <div>
          <p>The requirements for each kuudra tier will be listed to be able to comfortably clear each kuudra tier: 
          <ul>
            <li>Tier 1 Kuudra (Basic):</li>
            <p class="requirements">Armor: 3/4 Storm/Aurora with goggles</p>
            <p class="requirements">Weapon: Hyperion/Midas Staff</p>
            <p class="requirements">Ultility (Not required but can help massively): Orb/Flare, Kuudra perks (Fresh and Strongarm), Ember Armor</p>
            <li>Tier 2 Kuudra (Hot):</li>
            <p class="requirements">Armor: 3/4 Storm/Aurora with goggles</p>
            <p class="requirements">Weapon: Hyperion/Midas Staff</p>
            <p class="requirements">Ultility (Not required but can help massively): Orb/Flare, Kuudra perks (Fresh and Strongarm), Ember Armor, Terminator with Terror</p>
            <p id="note">Note that the requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 are relatively similar. This is because there is only 2 phases for kuudra in these tiers</p>
            <li>Tier 3 Kuudra (Burning)</li>
            <p class="requirements">This is where it gets more difficult as there are roles your party needs to satifies to ensure a clean and successful run.</p>
            <p class="requirements">Armor: 3/4 Storm/Hot 10* or higher Aurora with goggles</p>
            <p class="requirements">Weapon: Hyperion</p>
            <p class="requirements">Ultility (Not required but can help massively): Orb/Flare, Kuudra perks (Fresh and Strongarm), Ember Armor</p>
            <p class="requirements">If you are playing DPS, you will need a Terminator with at least 3/4 terror and 100 Attack Speed. Using 4 Toxic Arrow Poison can prove to be helpful as well when a party lacks the stats</p>
            <p class="requirements">If you are stunning, you will need to have a pickaxe that has the sufficient breaking power to mine kuudra pods in order to stun</p>
            <li>Tier 4 Kuudra (Fiery)</li>
            <p id="same-as-t3">Tier 4 is exactly the same as Tier 3, just with stronger monsters, pods take longer to destroy, DPS on kuudra require more hits, and supplies take longer to grab</p>
            <p class="requirements">Armor: 3/4 Storm/Burning 10* or higher Aurora with goggles</p>
            <p class="requirements">Weapon: Hyperion</p>
            <p class="requirements">Ultility (Not required but can help massively): Orb/Flare, Kuudra perks (Fresh and Strongarm), Ember Armor</p>
            <p class="requirements">If you are playing DPS, you will need a Terminator with at least 3/4 terror, 100 Attack Speed and at least 8 Toxic Arrow Poison. Duplex on the Terminator for an extra arrow is heavily recommended</p>
            <p class="requirements" id="last">If you are stunning, you will need to have a pickaxe that has the sufficient breaking power to mine kuudra pods in order to stun</p>
            <li>Tier 5 Kuudra (Infernal)</li>
            <p class="requirements">This is the final and hardest tier of Kuudra that you can fight. It adds in another phase to kuudra where you need to kill it a second time</p>
            <p class="requirements">Armor: 3/4 Storm/Burning 10* or higher Aurora with goggles. 3/4 10* Burning or higher Terror WITH Warden Helmet. Terror must have proper attributes for damage such as Dominance or Lifeline as well as Ferocious or Strong Mana for a quick final phase</p>
            <p class="requirements">Weapon: Hyperion, Terminator with Duplex or Fatal Tempo</p>
            <p class="requirements">Equipment: Equipment optimized for damage with terminator and with attributes for damage such as Dominance or Lifeline. If using Lifeline, Lava Shell Necklace is <code>REQUIRED</code>.
            <p class="requirements">Ultility: Overflux+ or SOS Flare, Maxed Perks (Fresh and Strongarm), Ember Armor, Armorshred Arrows, Endstone Sword, Ragnarok Axe, Reaper Armor (Not Required) </p>
            <p class="requirements">If you are playing DPS, you will need a Terminator with at least 3/4 terror, 100 Attack Speed, and 16 Toxic Arrow Poison</p>
            <p class="requirements">If you are stunning, you will need to have a pickaxe that has the sufficient breaking power to mine kuudra pods in order to stun. On top of stunning, you need to be able to animation skip kuudra's death in order to teleport the team into Kuudra's lair early for a quick and clean run using an enderpearl or sinseeker scythe</p>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li>Tier 1 (Basic):</li>
            <p>Step 1: Use your lava fishing rod and fish up the 6 supplies that are in the lava. One you fish them up, bring them back into the middle and place them in their respective spots<p>
              <p>Step 2: This phase begins after all the supplies have been brought into the middle. Start building the ballista by holding Shift and spam clicking LMB</p>
              <p>Step 3: This is when the ballista has been built. You have 2 options for this phase. The first one consists of fueling the ballista then shooting Kuudra when the charge is at 100% (4 Cells) while shooting an explosive chunk at kuudra. The second option is to stand and shoot all of the explosive chunks at kuudra. The first method is a lot faster and is typically better.</p>
              <li>Tier 2 (Hot):</li>
              <p>Similar to Tier 1 except for final phase</p>
              <p>Step 1: Use your lava fishing rod and fish up the 6 supplies that are in the lava. One you fish them up, bring them back into the middle and place them in their respective spots<p>
              <p>Step 2: This phase begins after all the supplies have been brought into the middle. Start building the ballista by holding Shift and spam clicking LMB</p>
              <p>Step 3: This is when the ballista has been built. You have 2 options for this phase. The first one consists of fueling the ballista then shooting Kuudra when the charge is at 100% (4 Cells) while shooting enough explosive chunks at kuudra to lower it to less than 50% HP. The second one requires shooting the ballista then DPS'ing the boss with terror and terminator. This one is typically a lot faster than the first but is a lot more expensive.</p>
              <li>Tier 3 (Burning):</li>
              <p>Step 1: Use your lava fishing rod and fish up the 6 supplies that are in the lava. One you fish them up, bring them back into the middle and place them in their respective spots<p>
              <p>Step 2: This phase begins after all the supplies have been brought into the middle. Start building the ballista by holding Shift and spam clicking LMB</p>
              <p>Step 3: This is when the ballista has been built. Your stunner wants to buy the "Cannonball" perk from the shop and instantly go inside of Kuudra to stun it. From here, your remaining 3 teammates need to switch into terror and use their terminator and DPS Kuudra from the side to ensure that once Kuudra is stunned, Kuudra will die.</p>
              <li>Tier 4 (Fiery):</li>
              <p>The exact same as Tier 3 Kuudra but Duplex on Terminator is highly recommended and more usage of Toxic Arrow Poison</p>
              <p>Step 1: Use your lava fishing rod and fish up the 6 supplies that are in the lava. One you fish them up, bring them back into the middle and place them in their respective spots<p>
              <p>Step 2: This phase begins after all the supplies have been brought into the middle. Start building the ballista by holding Shift and spam clicking LMB</p>
              <p>Step 3: This is when the ballista has been built. Your stunner wants to buy the "Cannonball" perk from the shop and instantly go inside of Kuudra to stun it. From here, your remaining 3 teammates need to switch into terror and use their terminator and DPS Kuudra from the side to ensure that once Kuudra is stunned, Kuudra will die.</p>
              <li>Tier 5 (Infernal):</li>
              <p>Step 1: Use your lava fishing rod and fish up the 6 supplies that are in the lava. One you fish them up, bring them back into the middle and place them in their respective spots<p>
              <p>Step 2: This phase begins after all the supplies have been brought into the middle. Start building the ballista by holding Shift and spam clicking LMB</p>
              <p>Step 3: This is when the ballista has been built. Your stunner wants to buy the "Cannonball" perk from the shop and instantly go inside of Kuudra to stun it. From here, your remaining 3 teammates need to switch into terror and use their terminator and DPS Kuudra from the side to ensure that once Kuudra is stunned, the DPS is enough to begin the final phase</p>
              <p>Step 4: If the stunner failed to animation cancel, the 3 DPS needs to go to the middle and jump down into Kuudra's Lair. At this point, everybody needs to swap into their damage equipment and quickswap armor to use Lifeline if necessary. The stunner should start to LB Kuudra 3 times with maxed terror stacks to hit Kuudra with 10+ arrows for the armorshred. During this phase, Kuudra will launch explosive chunks that will one shot you if you stand too close and tentacles will slam down. You need to be able to dodge these abilities and attack Kuudra in the intervals where the head pops out of the lava at the same time.<code>If you die during this phase, you cannot respawn.</code>

        <ul>
          <li>Practice makes perfect! As you do more and more kuudras, you will be able to grab supplies faster, learn safe spots, and overall be able to do kuudras a lot faster!</li>
          <li>Learn safe spots especially for T3+ Kuudras. They speed up the run tremendously when parties know safe spots</li>
          <li>Depending on the tier you are grinding, be sure to only buy profitable chests unless you want to get teeth quickly. This ensures maximum profit from kuudras!</li>
          <li>Enjoy your <code>kuudra</code> runs!</li>
